# Guide to MAE, MSE, and Simple Neuron Implementations

This Jupyter Notebook serves as a comprehensive guide to understanding and implementing Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and a simple neuron model in Python using TensorFlow. The notebook is designed to provide a hands-on approach to learning these fundamental concepts in machine learning and deep learning, making it accessible for beginners and useful for experienced practitioners looking to refresh their knowledge.

## Table of Contents

1. **Introduction to Loss Functions**
2. **Mean Absolute Error (MAE) Implementation**
3. **Mean Squared Error (MSE) Implementation**
4. **Simple Neuron Model Implementation**
5. **Conclusion**

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.6 or higher
- TensorFlow 2.x
- Jupyter Notebook

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**
```
git clone https://github.com/Artin200912/Loss-Functions.git
```
2. **Navigate to the project directory:**
